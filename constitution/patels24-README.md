For this Lab, I worked on the interpretations for articles 1-4. I looked at the wesbsite given to us for the text and also for help with interpreting the text. (https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) Then I took the analyis that I did and formatted it into a JSON file. In terms of the interpretations, I first read through the articles and tried to interpret what I could remember from high school. If I got stuck at any point or if one of the words didn't make sense, I looked at the website linked above to see how they explained. I then read their explanation and then used to build the interpretation. Afterwards, I went back through and added how each section would be relevant in our lives.
