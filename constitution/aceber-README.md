For this lab, I worked on the JavaScript to make the website interactive and to fetch the information stored in a JSON. I used jQuery and AJAX to accomplish this, utilizing labs from Intro to ITWS to accomplish this. I looked at our lab 7 to remember how to use AJAX to extract data from a JSON. As for jQuery, I looked through several labs to see how I implemented animations, which I used to fade in and out text for the history dropdown. The part I got stuck on was fixing the JavaScript calls when text was to be displayed for an article vs an amendment because our JSON stored these in a slightly different manner. To resolve this, I simply handled these conditions differently whereas originally I tried to make one line that handled both.
