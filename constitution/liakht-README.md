For this lab I worked on setting up our groups VM and interpretations of amendments 13-27. For setting up our group VM I had remembered much of the process from Intro to ITWS last year and did not run into many problems. The main change I had to make here was to rename the home.html instead of index.html so the VM would automatically pick it up. For the amendments I used the link provided us in class (https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) and interpreted it on my own. I would occasionally look up facts on google such as how long it took to ratify something.
