The votes are to be opened and counted by the President of the Senate, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives. A candidate must receive the majority of the votes of the electors to become President. If no one receives a majority, then the House of Representatives, with a quorum of two-thirds of the states being present, and a majority of all the states being necessary to make a choice, shall select the President from the three highest candidates. If the House does not select a President on or before March 4, the Vice-President acts as President until such time as one is selected. For a person to be elected Vice-President, he or she has to have a majority of the votes of the electors. If no one gets this majority, the Senate has to decide who is to be the Vice-President among the top two candidates. A quorum for this is two-thirds of the Senate, and to make a choice, it needs a majority of all Senators. A person who is not eligible to be President cannot become Vice-President."
