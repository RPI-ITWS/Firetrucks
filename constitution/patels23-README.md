WORK LOG:
For this Lab, I worked on the interpretations for articles 5-7 and Amendments 1-12. I used the website containing the constitution and created an interpretation of each section making them easier to understand. I also wrote how each section was relevant to our daily lives. I formatted it into a JSON file to be displayed dynamically through JavaScript.
